# COMP7230 Group Project
Winter Semester, 2021

## Project Proposal

### Canberra: Changing Gears on Bike Safety
_An investigation on the uphill battle facing cyclists_

### Group Members

1. Jonathon Longden (u7333077)

2. Tim Arney (u7378856)

3. Hugh Porter (u7398670)

### Overview

_A 2-3 paragraph overview of what the project is about and what will be delivered at the end of the semester._

This project will explore a number of aspects around cycling in the ACT:
1. The relationship between the number of cyclists and varying weather conditions;
2. The incidence of cycling crashes under varying weather conditions;
3. The incidence of cycling crashes under varying natural light conditions;
3. The prevalence of cycling crashes by geographical area.

### Hugh ADDED ###

This project will explore a number of aspects related to cycling in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), producing actionable suggestions on what can be done to reduce the rate of cycling accidents.

The project will expolore the following idea:
1. Whether their is a relationship between the number of cyclist and varying weather conditions;
2. If the rate of cycling crashes varies depending on weather conditions;
3. How the seasonal changes in natural light (sunrise/sunset) effects the rate of cycling crashes;
4. The geographical location of cycling crashes;

The project can also potentially explore:
1. If speed cameras reduce the number of cycling crashes;
2. The effects of street light distribution on cycling crashes which occur during hours of low lighting;
