#### Notes
- Discussed various ideas with Armin, determined that:
 - the datasets need not be overly large if the scope of the analysis is broader,
 - need to consider some data integration beyond simple space/time, eg. something semantic or more geospatial
 - assessment will be based on the computer science rather than the analytical outcomes
- Settled on cycling idea for project.
- Expanded scope to include geospatial integration with place names.
- Assigned visualations to Hugh.
- Decided to discontinue MEETINGS.md in favour of the group Discord channel.
